# Our Animals


1. Suraurwanda
 
Suraurwanda, meaning visit Rwanda in honor of the growing tourism sector in Rwanda, was born in November 2018 into Mafunzoâ€™s group to mother Taraja. His favorite playmate and best friend is Ihiriwe, the one-year old daughter of Ubuhamya. The two of them spend most of their resting time running and chasing each other, engaging in long wrestling games. You can frequently hear their loud laughter in the group.
