# Suraurwanda

Suraurwanda, meaning “visit Rwanda” in honor of the growing tourism sector in Rwanda, was born into Mafunzo’s group on Nov. 30, 2018. His mother is Taraja, and because Mafunzo is the only adult male of the group, we do not need genetic testing to prove he is the father.
Suraurwanda’s favorite playmate and best friend is Uhiriwe, the 1-year-old daughter of Ubuhamya. They were born just few months apart and are developing at same pace. They spend most of their time running and chasing each other, engaging in long wrestling games. Visitors frequently hear their loud laughter.
Suraurwanda is beginning to eat independently, but he cannot yet eat hard parts of the plants, so he limits his diet to leaves and soft stems, and still gets most of his nutrients from his mother’s milk. Taraja is a great mother, often letting Surauruwanda explore the world and play with friends, but is always close by just in case trouble arises.
Suraurwanda’s older brother, Ishimwe, is also a part of the group and provides an extra set of eyes to watch over Suraurwanda. Ishimwe, a 4-year old juvenile, can be adopted as well!
